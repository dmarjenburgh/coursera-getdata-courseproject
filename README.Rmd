# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

*Daniel Marjenburgh*

## How to use
This project uses data taken from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). Additional metadata for this dataset can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Be sure to set your R working directory to the dataset folder extracted from the
zipfile. The folder should have a `features.txt` file.

The [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script will generate two output files in your working
directory when sourced, provided the raw dataset can be found:

- [tidy.csv](tidy.csv)
- [summary.csv](summary.csv)

The [codebook](codeBook.md) contains information on the output files `tidy.csv`
and `summary.csv`, as well as description of the variable names and where they
come from.
